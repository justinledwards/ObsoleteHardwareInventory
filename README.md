C# app to automate scanning and printing of labels

Great for Microsoft shops that are retiring equipment, especially government agencies that are getting rid of Windows XP machines in their infrastructure.   

We used a cheap wireless barcode scanner with common hardware information stored in barcodes put inside a table.  At the end we used a single "space" character.

The app takes all data fields and saves them to an excel file with timestamp, and afterwards prints a label, and the process repeats.  

Copy the doc file in the Desktop folder to your desktop.  

Compile and enjoy.
